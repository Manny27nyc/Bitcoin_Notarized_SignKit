Bitcoin integration/staging tree

Development process
===================

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the
bitcoin development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial
change, then the patch submitter will be asked to start a
discussion (if they haven't already) on the mailing list:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=bitcoin-development

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a
good thing.  Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches
if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt)
or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
official, stable release versions of Bitcoin. If you would like to
help test

>>>>>>> 74a7502 (docs: add GPG-signed badge to README)

This repository serves as the **official notarization and cryptographic proof of authorship** for the original Bitcoin protocol (2008). It includes:

-  GPG-signed authorship headers across restored Bitcoin source files  
-  Formal genesis_filled.json declaration  
-  Visual authorship assertion (.png)  
-  Original configure.ac and CONTRIBUTING.md with metadata  
-  Verifiable cryptographic trail from 2008 to 2025  

This is the **first time** Bitcoins origin is presented with:
- Full signature proof  
- Licensing enforcement framework  
- Public authorship documentation
