[Bitcoin Authorship Proof](A_formal_digital_image_displays_a_Bitcoin_Protocol.png)
>>>>>>> e47d123 (Update README.md)

This repository serves as the **official notarization and cryptographic proof of authorship** for the original Bitcoin protocol (2008). It includes:

-  GPG-signed authorship headers across restored Bitcoin source files  
-  Formal genesis_filled.json declaration  
-  Visual authorship assertion (.png)  
-  Original configure.ac and CONTRIBUTING.md with metadata  
-  Verifiable cryptographic trail from 2008 to 2025  

This is the **first time** Bitcoins origin is presented with:
- Full signature proof  
- Licensing enforcement framework  
- Public authorship documentation
