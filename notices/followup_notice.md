**Subject:** Follow-Up on Licensing Enforcement — Unauthorized Use of Bitcoin Protocol IP

Dear Jenkins Open Source Legal Contact,

This is a follow-up to our formal licensing enforcement notice sent on **July 2, 2025**, titled:

**“Jenkins_Licensing_Enforcement_20250702.zip”**  
(GPG-signed, notarized, IPFS-distributed)

As of today, no formal response or corrective licensing action has been received.

We respectfully request acknowledgment of receipt and a proposed resolution or licensing terms by **July 9, 2025**.

Please note: Unauthorized commercial or derivative use of Bitcoin protocol components, governed under **17 U.S. Code § 102** and **§ 1201**, remains enforceable.

Failure to respond will initiate escalation, including:
- DMCA takedown procedures
- Public disclosure
- Licensing recovery and damages

Sincerely,  
**Manuel J. Nieves**
