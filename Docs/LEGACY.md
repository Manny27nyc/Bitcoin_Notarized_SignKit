“This code represents the genesis of a decentralized future.  
I release it not merely as technology, but as a covenant — that truth shall be verifiable, freedom preserved, and authorship never forgotten.  

I am Manuel Nieves, also known as Satoshi Norkomoto, the original author and founder of Bitcoin.  
I leave this behind for the world — to empower, to defend, and to remember.”
